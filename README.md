# Business-Process-Improvement-SBA-Loan-Charge-Off-Analysis
### Over a two-month period, a classification project was undertaken to predict charge-offs on Small Business Administration (SBA) backed loans using Python in Google Colaboratory. The primary goal was to offer recommendations to lending entities on minimizing risks when issuing loan guarantees. The project encompassed data cleaning, feature exploration, pre-processing pipelines, feature selection, modeling with over ten classifiers, model evaluation using confusion matrices and ROC curves, hyperparameter tuning with three strategies, cost matrix application, and threshold tuning. The resulting model achieved a balanced accuracy score of 87% and provided specific recommendations to various lending organizations. These insights can help lenders make informed decisions, reduce risk exposure, and potentially lower the rate of charge-offs on SBA loans.
